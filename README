This is my first Git hub project and I'll start with idea for I think most of programmers have, that is how to create reports in a easy way for screen and printer?

As I have decades in IT area, starting with Basic, Assembler and Cobol with line and matrix printers and I thought, that most reports never changed, even at HTML 5 era.

The idea is simple and I'm working to make it better, using the OO approach and I'll be glad with your ideas too.
